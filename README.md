# C-File-Explorer
My own file manager built with C and the `ncurses` library.
Provides a comprehensive set of command-line tools for navigating and managing files on Unix-like operating systems.

## üìñ Description
I built **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** from scratch as a self exercise. 
It leverages the `ncurses` library to create an interactive command-line application that allows users to perform common file management tasks without relying on a graphical desktop environment.
The application is designed to be lightweight, fast, and highly responsive, making it an ideal tool for server environments or low-resource systems.

## üöÄ Features
**Intuitive Navigation:** Navigate directories and files effortlessly using the up/down arrow keys and `Enter`.

**Hidden Files:** Toggle the visibility of hidden files and folders by launching the program with the `-a` flag.

**View:** Press `F2` to open and view the contents of any text file.

**Rename:** Press `c` to change the name of a selected file or directory.

**Create:** Press `F7` to create a new directory in the current path.

**Delete:** Press `F8` to safely delete a file or an empty directory after a confirmation prompt.

**Robust Error Handling:** The application handles common errors gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user and preventing crashes.

**Dynamic Display:** The UI automatically updates to reflect changes in the file system, ensuring you always have an up-to-date view of your current location.
